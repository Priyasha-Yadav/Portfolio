# 🌟 Priyasha Yadav — Portfolio Website

> A digital garden of creativity, caffeine, and code ☕💻✨

Welcome to the GitHub repo for **my personal portfolio website** — a little piece of the internet where I showcase the projects I’ve built, the passions I’ve pursued, and the skills I’ve sharpened (usually at 3 AM, because that’s when the magic happens 🦉🌌).

## ✨ Tech Stack

This website is built using a cocktail of the web's finest tools:

- **Frontend:** React.js + Tailwind CSS + Vite (blazing fast and aesthetic, like a coding racecar 🏎️💨)
- **Backend (if any):** Node.js / Express (or not, if it's a static wonder)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (because why scroll when you can *float*?)
- **Icons & Illustrations:** Lucide Icons, Heroicons, and lovingly crafted SVG magic

## 💼 What's Inside?

- An **About Me** section that tells my story — full of learning curves and curly braces.
- A **Projects** gallery that showcases what I’ve been building, breaking, and fixing again.
- A **Contact Me** page for anyone who wants to say hi (or offer free pizza 🍕👀).
- A sprinkle of personality, because code without character is just... syntax.
